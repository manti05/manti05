# Hi there! 👋

I'm Mantas — a Computing graduate based in Kaunas, Lithuania.

I enjoy shipping small-to-medium projects, then improving them through refactoring, documentation, and cleanup. Recently I've been focusing on Python projects and foundational web development.

**Primarily:** Python (projects), Java (coursework), JavaScript (web basics)
